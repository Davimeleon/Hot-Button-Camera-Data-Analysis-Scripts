# Hot-Button-Camera-Data-Analysis-Scripts

## About

This repository contains data analysis scripts for processing data collected using the Seek Thermal Starter Kit, in conjunction with the software found in the [Hot-Button-Camera repository](https://github.com/Davimeleon/Hot-Button-Camera.git). The repository includes two main programs: `dataAnalyzer.py` and `laserStimExtractor.py`.

### `laserStimExtractor.py`

This program processes the normal footage of a mouse, identifying pixels illuminated by a light that is activated during laser stimulation periods. The output consists of frames marking the start and end of each laser activation.

### `dataAnalyzer.py`

This program analyzes the frames of laser activation, as identified by `laserStimExtractor.py`, along with the binary file generated by the Hot-Button-Camera software. The analysis produces various graphs based on the data, enabling further insights into the experiment.
